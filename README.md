# firstprojectever
As a junior developer in training, this is my first attempt at completing a project in Java on my own. The goal of this project is to create a very simple, console style arcade fighting game.

This project is an opportunity to practice fundamental OOP concepts and is a WORK IN PROGRESS! :)
